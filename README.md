# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization with Python Libraries (Kaggle Automotive Dataset)

## Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to explore and visualize the Kaggle Automotive Dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. We aim to gain insights into various aspects of the dataset, including car attributes, pricing, and performance metrics.

## Conclusion:
Through this analysis, we have successfully explored and visualized different features of the automotive dataset. We identified key insights related to car pricing, horsepower distribution, and body styles. The visualization techniques employed provide a clear understanding of the data distribution and relationships between variables.

## Analysis Overview:
- Imported necessary libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Loaded the dataset and examined its structure using the head() and info() functions.
- Calculated the average price of automobiles in the dataset.
- Identified the cheapest and costliest cars based on price.
- Explored cars with horsepower greater than 100.
- Analyzed the number of hatchback cars available.
- Determined the most commonly found car makes in the dataset.
- Investigated cars priced above $40,000 and those priced below $7,000.
- Visualized data through univariate and bivariate plots using histograms, distribution plots, joint plots, pair plots, strip plots, box plots, and bar plots.

## Future Enhancements:
- Conduct further analysis on specific car makes or models.
- Implement advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Explore additional datasets for comparative analysis and feature engineering.
